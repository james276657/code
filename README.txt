This respository contains examples showing working source code from 
various projects in a range of languages.

-------

Linux
	
	C
		cscrape
			This c code is designed to be compiled with gcc using the 
			make file in a linux environment and driven with the included 
			BASH program.  Cscrape searches for and returns a list of items 
			for sale from Portland.craigslist.org.   A Linux command line
			project.
			
		Threaded_Producer_Consumer
			This c code for Linux demonstrates Threading and Semaphores
			in several Producer Consumer solutions.
			
		Turtle Compiler
			This c code along with Lex and Yacc is used to construct a 
			Turtle compiler which converts turtle source to turtle
			assembly programs suited to run in the included turtle
			emulator.
	 
Windows

	8086_Assembly
		Book_File_Reader
			An 8086 assembly language program built and debugged with
			masm32 and VS10 envrionments.  This assembly code generates 
			a windows program with a GUI window and menu.  The user can 
			choose a book info file to open.  The book date author and title
			are read in and sorted by date and are presented in a msgbox.
			
	C#
		TCP/IP
			Client and Server code using socket communications over network
			A VS10 project.

		Unit Test
			A programming project demonstrating unit test in C#.  A VS10
			project.
	C++
		Binary Search Tree
			This is a C++ implementation for an array based binary search
			tree with Insert and Delete methods as well as Inorder, Preorder,
			and Postorder display.  Array based trees are harder because
			post delete tree fixups require moving nodes as opposed to 
			just updating links.  Example driver code is provided.
			A VS10 project.
	SQL
		Deko Database
			This is an Access 2010 and an Oracle 10G implementation of a
			small company database.  Given some input spreadsheets with
			various data including employees, dependants, and evaluations,
			I reduced the dataset to 3NF and instantiated Access and 10G
			solutions.
