I've created an N Unit test program that that tests several
functions.  Most of the functions tested are from my Lab2 
submission including backspace, getscore, getclassifier,
and getoccupation.  I threw in a fibonacci function and
have it intentionally failing in unit test.

I was unable to test most interactive and console portions
of Lab2 with N unit.  In some cases I could work around 
console calls with a "Testing" boolean.

The program is written in C Sharp.  The source files are in the
lab3_CST236 directory.  You can open the project in Visual Studio 10
using the lab3_CST236.sln file.  You can build and run the program
inside VS10.
